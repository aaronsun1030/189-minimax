# 189 Minimax
Hi! This repo contains materials for the CS189 Project T. We hope that students can use this repo to learn all about minimax and how it can be applied to various topics.
## Learning Goals
- Explore ideas necessary to implement minimax: heuristic, depth
- Implement basic Minimax on chess
- Improve our algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Speed up further using a transposition table, and compare the implementations of the three functions
- Use iterative deepning to create a function which can search using a given amount of time
## Navigating the Repo
Our repo contains three main sections: teaching, assignments, and quiz.
- Teaching: contains both a note and slideshow which covers the material required for the assignments.
- Assignments: contains an introductory Jupyter Notebook which walks the student through basic minimax and pruning, as well as a more involved coding assignment.
- Quiz: contains a brief quiz which can be used to test a student's understanding.
