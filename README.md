# 189 Minimax
Hi! This repo contains materials for the CS189 Project T. We hope that students can use this repo to learn all about minimax and how it can be applied to various topics.
## Learning Goals
- Explore ideas necessary to implement minimax: heuristic, depth
- Understand how alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening can be used to improve minimax
- Implement these algorithms and some extensions to create Chess AIs that can play competitive games and solve Chess puzzles
## Navigating the Repo
Our repo contains three main sections: teaching, assignments, and quiz.
- Teaching: contains both a note and slideshow which covers the material required for the assignments.
- Assignments: contains an introductory Jupyter Notebook which walks the student through basic minimax and pruning, as well as a more involved coding assignment.
- Quiz: contains a brief quiz which can be used to test a student's understanding.
